# Decision Tree-Machine Learning
This is a PYTHON code that uses Machine Learning to perform Decision Tree.
The data are taken from IBM Developer Skills Network and can be found at https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/drug200.csv 
This code use Entropy as criterion to generate decision tree. 
The code will generate: 
1) Histogram plot for every feature. 
2) Output file that contains:
   Print Train and Test set dimensions.
   Print the accuracy score for the prediction tree.
3) Plot Decision Tree for the training data.
